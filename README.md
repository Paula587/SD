**SD201 Mining of Large Datasets**

The course will present algorithms for data analysis and mining while focusing on mining
massive datasets such as large-scale network data. It will focus on both practical and theoretical
aspects of data mining. During the course, the students will become familiar with the most
successful algorithms for clustering, ranking, mining frequent itemsets, recommender systems,
as well as community and event detection. Students will work on a small project where they will
implement some of the algorithms above in Hadoop (one of the most successful systems to
process massive amounts of data) and analyze real-world data.

**SD202 Databases/Bases de données**

Nowadays, databases are the core of any information system. Appearing in the 1980s, relational
database systems have evolved continuously and integrated more than 30 years of research and
technology. The objective of this course is to understand the foundations of databases, their
design and their management. It focuses on relational systems which represent the most
sophisticated and successful technology in this field. The techniques that are presented highlight
important concepts, such as:
- The relational model
- Relational algebra and SQL
- Database design
- Consistency and integrity etc.

**SD212 Graph Mining**

The focus of this course is on graph mining, a set of techniques for analysing and learning from
graph data (e.g., social networks, Web graphs, knowledge graphs, biological networks)
You will learn how real graphs are structured, with a focus on the scale-free and small-world
properties.
You will also learn how to find the most important nodes in the graph, how to detect clusters of
nodes, and how to predict labels using the graph structure.
A large part of the course will be devoted to programming in Python where you will have to
implement various algorithms for analysing real datasets.

**SD-TSIA204 Statistics: linear models/Statistique : modèles linéaires**

In this course, we will first introduce the linear model for least square regression as well as
present a more general framework that also includes logistic regression. We will consider the
tasks of estimation and tests in these models. The last part of the course will be devoted to
model selection, based on the norm L1 regularization and on greedy selection approaches.

**SD-TSIA205 Advanced Statistics/Statistique avancée**

In many situations, data available for statistical tasks (estimation, prediction) are so complex that
parametric modeling is completely in vain, at least upon initial analysis. The purpose of this
course is to present less rigid statistical techniques as well as the theoretical issues related to
their practical implementation - the price to be paid for an increased flexibility being the possibility
for the model selected to overfit the data.
Through examples, the minimax viewpoint for nonparametric estimation will be presented as
well as the trade-off bias/variance depending on the tuning of the model complexity and the
notion of Empirical Risk Minimization, the main paradigm of Statistical Learning theory will be
introduced.

**SD-TSIA210 Machine Learning**

Statistical learning is concerned with the inference of models for pattern recognition, the
prediction and diagnostic in a probabilistic and statistical setting.
The course first presents how to set a supervised learning problem both in classification and
regression, how to solve the underlying optimization task and how to evaluate the resulting
estimates. In supervised classification, both discriminant and generative approaches will be
presented. A short introduction to unsupervised learning will conclude the course.

**SD-TSIA211 Optimization for Machine Learning**

A broad class of machine learning problems boils down to the minimization of a functional
(typically an empirical risk). Optimization methods are therefore at the heart of practical machine
learning. In this module, the students will learn a collection of theoretical foundations in the
continuity of the previous optimization course and will discover several techniques allowing to
specifically address the case of massive data sets.

**SD-TSIA214 Machine learning for Text Mining**

Objectives
Text mining is a progressing and challenging domain. For example, a lot of efforts have been
recently dedicated to the development of methods able to analyze opinion data available on the social Web. The first objective of this course is to tackle the different methods of language
processing and machine learning underlying text and opinion mining.
During this course, the students will acquire theoretical and technical skill on advanced machine
learning methods and natural language processing. This course is designed for students who will
be attending classes and labs.
